                <p> I have both been interested and involved in sports ever since I could hold a bat. I've participated in a range of sports, but baseball and 
                    softball have always piqued my interest the most. Even though I'm in college and don't play on any teams anymore, I still have a passion for 
                    the game. I became aware of the full potential and power of sports analytics after watching the film <i>Moneyball</i> and thinking back on many 
                    previous games. I started to question whether data analysis might have been able to alter some of the results. What if we could've figured 
                    out how our opponent's patterns were derived? What if we could've used data to our advantage in order to obtain a competitive advantage? 
                    Motivated by these inquiries, I began to explore the realm of sports analytics and technology. What started out as an attempt to comprehend 
                    a single play in a specific game developed into a deep understanding of the potential of data-driven decision-making in sports. Here are a 
                    few analytical projects that demonstrate my interest in sports and some others that highlight my technical abilities in other tech-related 
                    fields:
